The idea of the project is quite simple, it extracts data from a MySQL database. Using LangChain's capabilities to convert natural language queries into SQL queries, the system is designed to allow users to ask questions about the database, generate queries, or even update tables if needed. By combining these technologies, developers can create scalable and interactive applications that bridge the gap between human language and structured data.
